  PHP + mysqli

I would call this mini PHP application worked in PHP and mysqli extension. It's about adding some
names in input and types from database list. After adding names and types I've used few arrays
combined with SQL commands where I did some actions like sorting/counting and more similar things with arrays
and all changes are showed in 2 tables on fronted.
