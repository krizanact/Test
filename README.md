  PHP + mySQL

I would call this mini PHP task worked in PHP and mySQL. It's about adding some
names in input and types from database list related to input. After adding names and types I've used few arrays
combined with SQL commands where I did some actions like sorting/counting and more similar things with arrays
and all changes are showed in 2 tables.
